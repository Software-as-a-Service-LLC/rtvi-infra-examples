# RTVI - Example bot and runner

This project includes two applications:

üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è `runner` HTTP service for starting new realtime sessions by spawning new bot agents at the specified transport URL.

ü§ñ `bot` The chatbot agent, leveraging Pipecat and the library's RTVI framework implementation.

They are intended as examples, containing everything you need to work with the RTVI client in local development. It can be used as a template for building your own realtime AI voice and video workflows.

The example bot included in this project does not require any GPU-enabled platform to run, instead opting for AI services that are available via services. You can, of course, configure your pipeline to use on-premises models if you prefer.


## Quickstart

**Please note: the Daily SDK (`daily-python`) required by the bot files is not currently supported on Windows. The required dependencies will currently fail to install unless you use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).**

#### Install the development dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # or OS equivalent
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
```

Create environment files for both apps:

```bash
cp runner/env.example runner/.env
cp bot/env.example bot/.env
```

Enter the required API keys for both applications.


#### Start the bot runner server:

```bash
cd runner
python bot_runner.py --host localhost --reload
```

#### Send a POST request to the runner URL:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:7860' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "config": {
        "llm": {
            "model": "llama3-70b-8192",
            "messages": [
                {
                    "role": "system",
                    "content": "You are a helpful assistant named Chatbot. Briefly say hello!"
                }
            ]
        },
        "tts": {
            "voice": "79a125e8-cd45-4c13-8a67-188112f4dd22"
        }
    }
}'
```

Note: the first time you run this method, it may take a few minutes to download the necessary dependencies.


## Overview

This repo lays out an example local runner and bot file that can be used in local development with an RTVI client. It doesn't make any hosting platform assumptions and simply launches the bot as a subprocess of the runner. 

You can read more about the deployment pattern adopted in this example [here](https://docs.pipecat.ai/deployment/pattern).


## HTTP service / bot runner

In order for your client to start a new realtime session with your bot, you should create an HTTP service that expects a JSON formatted pipeline configuration object. When a new request is sent, the runner will spawn a new bot agent, passing the necessary connectivity and configuration details.


### Configuration options

#### Project `.env`

The runner looks for the following environment variables in order to spawn your agent:

`HOST_WHITELIST`

A comma-delimited list of allowed hosts. This will prevent outside requests from spawning a bot.

_Note: this is for illustrative purposes as a rudimentary example of securing your runner. Malicious actors can easily spoof the request domain. In production use-cases, you should protect your runner service with the necessary measures to prevent unwanted activity._

`USE_DEBUG_ROOM`

By default, a runner will create a new room for the realtime session with each request. In local development, you may prefer to work with the same room each time (to avoid exceeding transport service room limits, etc.). Pass the name of the room here, e.g., `USE_DEBUG_ROOM=test`. In the case of Daily, this should be just the room name, not the full URL.

`DAILY_API_KEY`

This example is configured to use [Daily](https://www.daily.co) as the default realtime media transport. You can obtain your developer key for your domain by visiting your [Daily dashboard](https://dashboard.daily.co).

`DAILY_DOMAIN`

Your Daily account domain, e.g., `https://rtvi.daily.co` where `rtvi` is the name of the domain you chose when creating your account. This can also be found on your Daily dashboard.


## Bot file

The example bot file included in this project uses the [Pipecat](https://www.pipecat.ai) RTVI framework implementation to run a realtime voice session. It uses the following services:

- [Daily](www.daily.co) for realtime media transport (WebRTC)
- Daily for real-time user transcription (Deepgram)
- [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) for LLM inference. Note: you can use whichever OpenAI compatible service you prefer, such as Groq.
- [Cartesia](https://cartesia.ai/) for text-to-speech.


#### Project `.env`

Your bot file requires the necessary service API keys to run inference based on the configuration of your RTVI pipeline or request services. Out of the box, we implement both Cartesia and Groq.

You do not need to pass your Daily API key to this app as an access is sent from the bot runner, allowing it to connect to the room. If working with the defaults, your .env file should look like this:

```bash
CARTESIA_API_KEY=your-key-here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-groq-key-here
```

## Building docker containers

Both the `runner` and `bot` apps contain example Dockerfiles that you can use to build and deploy your applications. 

We recommend deploying these apps independently, but please note that doing so will require you to configure your runner accordingly to your chosen hosting platform. An example of how to do this with Fly.io can be found [here](https://docs.pipecat.ai/deployment/fly).


You can build your apps like this:

```bash
docker build -t registry.fly.io/rtvi-runner:latest .

docker build -t registry.fly.io/rtvi-bot:latest . --platform linux/amd64
```

_Note: The bot application requires PyTorch / CUDA to leverage Silero VAD. For this reason, please target the correct platform during build. Torch significantly increases the size of the resulting image; we have found that Torch CPU does not work as well with Silero (even though no GPU is required for this demo.)_
